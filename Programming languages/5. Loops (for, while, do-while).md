# Loops in Programming

Loops allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times until a condition is met. They are essential for automating repetitive tasks and processing collections of data.

## What Is a Loop?
A **loop** repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition remains true. This lets you avoid writing the same code multiple times.

```python
# Example: print numbers 1 to 5
i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
```

---

## `for` Loop
Iterates over a sequence (list, array, range) a fixed number of times.

### JavaScript
```js
let fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];
for (let i = 0; i < fruits.length; i++) {
  console.log(fruits[i]);
}
```

### Python
```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

**Key points:**
- JavaScript uses an index-based loop.
- Python loops directly over items.

---

## `while` Loop
Runs as long as a condition remains true.

### JavaScript
```js
let count = 1;
while (count <= 5) {
  console.log(count);
  count++;
}
```

### Python
```python
count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

**Key points:**
- Check the condition at the start.
- Ensure the condition eventually becomes false to avoid infinite loops.

---

## `do-while` Loop
Like a `while` loop but guarantees at least one execution.

### JavaScript
```js
let num = 1;
do {
  console.log(num);
  num++;
} while (num <= 5);
```

### Python (simulate)
Python doesn’t have `do-while`, but you can simulate it:
```python
num = 1
while True:
    print(num)
    num += 1
    if num > 5:
        break
```

---

## Loop Control: `break` and `continue`
- **`break`**: Exit the loop immediately.
- **`continue`**: Skip the rest of the current iteration and continue with the next.

```js
for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
  if (i === 5) break;      // stops at 5
  if (i % 2 === 0) continue; // skips even numbers
  console.log(i);          // prints 1, 3
}
```

```python
for i in range(1, 11):
    if i == 5:
        break
    if i % 2 == 0:
        continue
    print(i)               # prints 1, 3
```

---

## Infinite Loops
Happen when the loop’s exit condition is never met.

```js
// Infinite JS loop - avoid!
while (true) {
  console.log("This never stops");
}
```

```python
# Infinite Python loop - avoid!
while True:
    pass
```

Always ensure your loop’s condition can become false or include a `break`.

---

## Best Practices
- Choose the right loop type for clarity.
- Avoid modifying loop counters inside nested loops.
- Use descriptive variable names (`index`, `item`).
- Keep loop bodies small; delegate work to functions.
- Always verify exit conditions to prevent infinite loops.

## Common Errors & How to Fix Them

| Error                     | Cause                                      | Fix                                                      |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Off-by-one                | Loop boundary conditions incorrect         | Check `<`, `<=`, `>` and `>=` logic                     |
| Infinite loop             | Exit condition never met                   | Update variables correctly or add `break`               |
| Unexpected behavior       | Modifying list/array inside loop           | Avoid changing collection size while iterating          |

## Exercises

1. Use a `for` loop to sum numbers 1–100.
2. Use a `while` loop to find the first number divisible by 7 and 5.
3. Print a pyramid of `#` characters with height 5 using nested loops.
4. Experiment: remove the `break` in a loop that uses it and observe what happens.

Great work! You now know how to repeat actions with `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops. Keep practicing by combining loops with conditionals and functions for more complex tasks.
