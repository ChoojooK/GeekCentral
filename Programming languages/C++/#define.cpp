// #define is a way to tell the C++ preprocessor to replace text in your code before it gets compiled.

// #define performs text substitution without type checking, so be careful with how you use it.

// Unlike regular code, #define does not end with a semicolon.

// The scope of a #define is global within the file or until itâ€™s undefined.

#include <iostream>

#define MAX_VALUE 100
#define PI 3.14159

int main() {
    std::cout << "Max value: " << MAX_VALUE << std::endl;
    std::cout << "PI: " << PI << std::endl;

    // Attempting to modify a defined constant will not result in a compilation error
    // MAX_VALUE = 200; // No compilation error, but does not modify the value of MAX_VALUE

    return 0;
}
