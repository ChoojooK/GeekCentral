Socket programming in Python enables you to build networked applications that communicate over a network using socketsâ€”endpoints for sending and receiving data between two nodes.
With socket programming, you can create client-server applications: one program acts as the server, listening for incoming connections, while another program serves as the client, connecting to the server to exchange data.
To establish a connection, run the server and client scripts in separate terminals.

This example provides a foundational introduction to socket programming in Python, helping you get started with creating your own networked applications.
