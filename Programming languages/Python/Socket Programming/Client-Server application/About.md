Socket programming in Python allows you to create networked applications that communicate using sockets, which are endpoints for sending and receiving data between two nodes over a network. You can use socket programming to create client-server applications, where one program acts as a server, waiting for incoming connections, and another program acts as a client, connecting to the server to send or receive data.

You can run the server and client scripts separately in different terminals to establish a connection between them. This is just a basic example to get you started with socket programming in Python.
