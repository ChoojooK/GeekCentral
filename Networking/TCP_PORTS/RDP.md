**RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)**  
- **Port**: 3389  
- **Description**: RDP is a protocol developed by Microsoft that allows users to connect to and control a remote computer over a network. It provides a graphical interface to interact with the remote system as if the user were physically present at the machine.

   **How It Works**:
   - **Connection**: The client connects to the remote computer on port 3389.
   - **Authentication**: Users authenticate with the remote system using credentials (username and password).
   - **Session**: Once authenticated, users can see the remote desktop, interact with applications, and manage files.

   **Key Points**:
   - **Remote Access**: Enables users to access and control remote systems, useful for remote administration, technical support, and telecommuting.
   - **Graphical Interface**: Provides a full graphical interface to interact with the remote system, supporting various screen resolutions and display settings.
   - **Encryption**: RDP includes encryption to protect the data transmitted between the client and the remote system.

RDP is widely used for remote management of Windows systems and is integral to remote work environments and IT support.
