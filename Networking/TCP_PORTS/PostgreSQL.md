**PostgreSQL**  
- **Port**: 5432  
- **Description**: PostgreSQL is an open-source, advanced relational database management system (RDBMS) known for its extensibility, standards compliance, and support for complex queries and data types. It uses SQL (Structured Query Language) for database management and operations.

   **How It Works**:
   - **Connection**: The PostgreSQL client connects to the PostgreSQL server on port 5432.
   - **Authentication**: The client authenticates using credentials such as a username and password.
   - **Queries**: SQL commands are used to interact with the database, including querying, inserting, updating, and deleting records.
   - **Data Management**: PostgreSQL supports advanced data types, indexing, full-text search, and custom functions, allowing for sophisticated data management and querying.

   **Key Points**:
   - **Extensibility**: Supports custom data types, operators, and functions, and allows developers to extend its capabilities with plugins and extensions.
   - **Standards Compliance**: Adheres to SQL standards and supports complex queries, joins, and transactions.
   - **ACID Compliance**: Ensures reliable transactions and data integrity through features like atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability.

PostgreSQL is favored for its robustness and advanced features, making it suitable for complex applications and data analytics, from web applications to enterprise-level systems.
