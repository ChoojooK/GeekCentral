**MySQL**  
- **Port**: 3306  
- **Description**: MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) used for managing and querying databases. It uses SQL (Structured Query Language) to handle and manipulate data stored in tables.

   **How It Works**:
   - **Connection**: The MySQL client connects to the MySQL server on port 3306.
   - **Authentication**: The client authenticates using a username and password.
   - **Queries**: SQL commands are sent from the client to the server to perform operations such as querying data, updating records, and managing database structures.
   - **Data Management**: MySQL stores data in structured tables with rows and columns, and supports features like indexing, transactions, and joins to efficiently manage and retrieve data.

   **Key Points**:
   - **Performance**: Known for its speed and reliability, MySQL is widely used in web applications and high-performance environments.
   - **Scalability**: Supports large databases and can scale vertically (by adding more resources to a single server) or horizontally (by distributing data across multiple servers).
   - **Open-Source**: MySQL is available under an open-source license, making it accessible and customizable for various use cases.

MySQL is a popular choice for web-based applications, including content management systems like WordPress and enterprise-level applications, due to its robust performance and flexibility.
