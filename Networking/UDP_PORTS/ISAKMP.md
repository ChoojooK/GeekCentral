**ISAKMP (Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol)**  
- **Port**: 500 (UDP)  
- **Description**: ISAKMP is a protocol used to establish, negotiate, and manage security associations (SAs) in IPsec (Internet Protocol Security) connections. It defines the procedures and packet formats needed to establish a secure and authenticated communication channel between two parties, such as a client and a VPN gateway.

   **How It Works**:
   - **Security Association (SA)**: ISAKMP helps set up SAs, which contain all the necessary information for secure communications, including cryptographic algorithms and keys.
   - **Key Exchange**: ISAKMP, usually in combination with IKE (Internet Key Exchange), securely exchanges cryptographic keys used to encrypt and authenticate IPsec traffic.
   - **Phases**:
     - **Phase 1**: ISAKMP negotiates a secure, authenticated channel between two peers (using either main mode or aggressive mode).
     - **Phase 2**: After a secure channel is established, ISAKMP negotiates the IPsec SAs for protecting actual data traffic (quick mode).

   **Key Points**:
   - **VPNs and IPsec**: ISAKMP is primarily used in virtual private networks (VPNs) to ensure secure IPsec communications.
   - **Flexibility**: It allows for the negotiation of different security parameters, including encryption and authentication algorithms, depending on the security policy.
   - **Security**: ISAKMP ensures that both peers are authenticated and that the keys used for encryption and authentication are exchanged securely.

ISAKMP is essential in setting up secure, encrypted communications in IPsec, making it a key protocol in securing VPNs and other network connections.
