TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is one of the main protocols of the Internet Protocol Suite, which is commonly referred to as TCP/IP. It provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data between applications running on hosts in a network. Here's an overview of TCP:

1. **Connection-Oriented Protocol**: TCP establishes a connection between the sender and receiver before transmitting data. This connection is a virtual circuit, ensuring reliable data transfer.

2. **Reliable Data Transmission**: TCP ensures that data transmitted from one end is received correctly and in the same order by the other end. It achieves this through sequence numbers, acknowledgments, and retransmissions.

3. **Flow Control**: TCP implements flow control mechanisms to prevent a fast sender from overwhelming a slow receiver. It uses sliding window protocols to regulate the amount of data sent before receiving acknowledgments.

4. **Congestion Control**: TCP adapts to network congestion by adjusting the transmission rate based on network conditions. It uses algorithms like slow start, congestion avoidance, and fast retransmit to manage congestion and ensure fair bandwidth utilization.

5. **Full Duplex Communication**: TCP supports full-duplex communication, allowing data to be transmitted in both directions simultaneously.

6. **Three-Way Handshake**: TCP uses a three-way handshake process to establish a connection between the sender and receiver. This process involves SYN (synchronize), SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledge), and ACK (acknowledge) segments to synchronize sequence numbers and negotiate connection parameters.

7. **Connection Termination**: TCP employs a four-way handshake to gracefully terminate a connection. It involves FIN (finish), FIN-ACK (finish-acknowledge), and ACK segments exchanged between the sender and receiver.

TCP is widely used in applications such as web browsing, email, file transfer, and remote administration. It provides a reliable and efficient communication mechanism over IP networks. However, TCP's reliability comes at the cost of higher overhead compared to UDP (User Datagram Protocol), another transport layer protocol in the TCP/IP suite.
